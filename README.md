# openlaneskynet130

This course teaches you how to design your own computer chips (ASICs) using the free, open-source Sky130 process and tools like OpenLANE, Magic, and OpenSTA. You will learn the basics of chip structure, architecture, and how software translates to hardware, then move step-by-step through designing, simulating, and testing chip components, floorplanning, routing, and timing analysis. Through hands-on labs, you will practice creating layouts, running simulations, checking for errors, and preparing your design so it can be fabricated, giving you practical experience in the entire open-source chip design workflow from RTL (circuit code) to GDS (chip layout).

✅ How chips are made
– Understanding chip parts (die, core, pads, IPs)
– Basic computer architecture (RISC-V)
– How software instructions translate into hardware

✅ Using OpenLANE and open-source tools
– Automate the design process from your circuit code (RTL) to a chip layout (GDS)
– Learn floorplanning (how to arrange components efficiently on your chip)
– Power planning, pin placement, and routing

✅ Cell design and simulations
– Designing small building blocks of chips (like inverters) using Magic (layout tool)
– Testing their behavior with SPICE simulations

✅ Timing analysis
– Ensuring your chip runs correctly and fast enough
– Understanding clock tree design and signal integrity

✅ Hands-on labs
– You will practice real chip design flows using Sky130 PDK (Process Design Kit)
– Generate and analyze layouts
– Run simulations and check for errors
– Prepare your design to be ready for fabrication
